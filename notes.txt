Before connecting an LED, you will need a resistor (resists electricity as in the name) to help not power the LED too much
  - Unit of resistance is called the Ohm
  - We denote the values of resistors in k立 (1,000 立) and M立 (1,000,000 立). These are called kilo-ohms and mega-ohms.
  - The positive side of the LED is the longer side
    - Connect the resistor first so the LED doesn't burn out
    - Positive first then negative
